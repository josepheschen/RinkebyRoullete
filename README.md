# RinkebyRoullete
This is our final project for CS481A3 at Colorado State University. 

The goal for the web application is to interact with the Rinkeby Ethereum test blockchain and create an interactive roullete application. We will be writing the smart contract code in Solidity and the front-end code in React.

We also will be testing our application and interations with the blockchain with a variety of tools such as Truffle and Ganache.

Enjoy!
